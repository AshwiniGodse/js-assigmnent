    <h1>Difference between var, let, const</h1>
    <h2>var</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.</p>
    <p>Example: var a =10;
        <br>
        Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
        The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
        The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.</p>

    <h2>let</h2>
    <p>The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.</p>
    <p>Example: let a =10;
        <br>
        The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
        It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.</p>

        <h2>const</h2>
        <p>const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.</p>
        <p>Example: const a =10;</p>
